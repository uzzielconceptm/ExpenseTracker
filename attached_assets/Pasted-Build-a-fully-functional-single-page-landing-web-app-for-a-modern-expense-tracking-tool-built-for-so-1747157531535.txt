Build a fully functional single-page landing web app for a modern expense tracking tool built for solopreneurs. The app should be responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile use.
Goals:
•	Clearly communicate the product's key benefits
•	Provide a smooth experience that allows users to explore features and request early access or sign up
•	Integrate functionality such as demo workflows, interactive UI components, and form inputs
Core Layout Requirements:
1.	Hero Section
o	Bold headline: “Smart Expense Tracking Built for Solopreneurs”
o	Subheadline explaining benefit: “Stop losing receipts. Start automating your audit trail.”
o	CTA button: “Try It Free” or “Request Early Access”
o	Light animation or image of dashboard and receipt-matching process
2.	Feature Highlights (with Icons or Mini Demos)
o	Audit Trail Automation
o	Auto-match receipts to credit cards & bank transactions
o	Email scanning to detect receipts (Gmail, Outlook integrations)
o	Manual receipt uploads with smart matching
o	Workflow tool for unmatched receipts with quick tagging
o	Use toggles or hover cards to expand on each feature
3.	Interactive Demo or Walkthrough Section
o	Simulated interface that shows the matching process
o	Upload/scan demo button (mocked)
o	Visual of a receipt being matched to a bank transaction
4.	Testimonials or Use Cases
o	Quotes from freelancers/consultants/creators who use the product
o	Emphasize how it saves time, improves tax prep, and eliminates chaos
5.	Pricing Preview or Free Trial CTA Section
o	“Try free for 14 days — no credit card required”
o	Simple 2- or 3-tier card layout for future pricing structure
6.	Email Collection or Account Creation Form
o	Clean, minimal form with email, business name, and use case
o	Connected to a backend service or Airtable/GSheet (if supported by tool)
7.	Footer with basic navigation links
o	About, Privacy, Contact
Design & Functionality Notes:
•	Use modern UI design: flat, minimal, with soft shadows and vibrant accent color (like cobalt blue or mint green)
•	Use animations/transitions on hover and scroll
•	Include basic client-side logic to simulate receipt-matching steps (e.g., upload > show spinner > success)
•	Page should be SEO-friendly and fast-loading
