I’d like to completely update the content of this landing page using the following copy and structure. Please do the following:
Update the Navigation Menu:
Change the brand name to FinMatch
Update menu links to:
Features, How It Works, For Soloprenours and Accountants, Security, Early Access
Ensure each item links to the correct section on the page using anchors (e.g., #features, #how-it-works, etc.)
Header Section (Hero):
Hero Tagline:
“Receipts, bank transactions, and expenses—organized in one place.”
Subheadline:
“Automatically extract receipts from email and match them to your bank transactions.”
Primary CTA button:
“Get early access”
Secondary CTA:
“See how it works” (this should scroll to the How It Works section)
Primary Pain Section:
Title: “Why most expense tools fail solo workers”
Copy:
“Manual data entry, missing receipts, and tax-time stress.”
Primary Benefit Section:
Copy block:
“Save hours and stay tax-ready — no more digging through emails.”
Features Section (#features):
Headline: “Designed for real business workflows”
Feature list (bullets):
Auto-email receipt extraction
Bank and card matching
Tax-category tagging
Real-time reports
Invite your accountant for free
Custom rules for auto-categorization
“How It Works” Section (#how-it-works):
Layout idea: 3-step visual or simple timeline
Example steps:
Connect your email
We find receipts and match them to your transactions
You get clean, audit-ready records
“For Soloprenours and Accountants” Section (#for-soloprenours-accountants):
Headline: “Built for solopreneurs and bookkeepers”
Add a trust block:
“Used by early-access accountants in the U.S.”
Display Gmail and Bank icons (no partner text)
CTA Repetition Section (#early-access):
Headline: “Start organizing your finances in minutes”
CTA Button: “Join the waitlist”
Secondary links:
“Talk to an expert”, “Try it free”
Footer:
Reaffirm brand name FinMatch
Light disclaimer: “FinMatch is not affiliated with any banking institution. Gmail is a trademark of Google.”
Tone:
Keep the tone simple, reassuring, and results-driven. Speak to busy, overwhelmed professionals (solopreneurs, freelancers, bookkeepers, accountants).
Font:
Use the same bold, modern font used in the hero section throughout the page.
Please apply this copy and structure throughout the page and ensure all navigation links correctly anchor to the intended sections.
