# Complete Railway Dashboard Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project Files

Your ExactusBooks application is ready for deployment. Create a deployment package by:

1. **Archive your project** (excluding these folders):
   - `node_modules/` 
   - `dist/`
   - `.git/` (if present)

2. **Include all necessary files**:
   - All source code (`client/`, `server/`, `shared/`)
   - `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - `railway.json` (deployment configuration)
   - Configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.)
   - Database migrations (`migrations/` folder)

## Step 2: Deploy via Railway Dashboard

1. **Access Railway**
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Find your "exactus" project or create new one

2. **Upload Method**
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo" (if using GitHub)
   - Or use "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository or upload ZIP file

3. **Automatic Configuration**
   Railway will detect your `railway.json` configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "builder": "NIXPACKS"
     },
     "deploy": {
       "startCommand": "npm start",
       "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
       "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
     }
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Environment Variables

Set these in Railway Dashboard → Variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-string-here
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Important**: Replace `DATABASE_URL` with your actual PostgreSQL connection string.

## Step 4: Build Process

Railway will automatically:
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Push database schema (`npx drizzle-kit push`)
3. Build application (`npm run build`)
4. Start server (`npm start`)

## Step 5: Domain Access

Your deployed app will be available at:
- **Primary**: `https://exactus.up.railway.app/`
- **Custom domain**: Configure in Railway dashboard if needed

## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

After deployment, verify these endpoints:

- **Landing Page**: `/`
- **Authentication**: `/auth`
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` (requires login)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
  - `GET /api/auth/me` - User profile
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

## Features Included in Deployment

✅ Complete JWT authentication system
✅ Secure password hashing with bcrypt
✅ User registration and login
✅ Protected routes and middleware
✅ PostgreSQL database integration
✅ Responsive frontend design
✅ Production-ready server configuration
✅ Automatic port detection for Railway

## Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure DATABASE_URL is valid and accessible
4. Check that all required dependencies are in package.json

**If authentication doesn't work:**
1. Verify JWT_SECRET is set
2. Check database connection
3. Ensure users table exists (should be created automatically)

Your application is production-ready with all authentication features working and tested.
